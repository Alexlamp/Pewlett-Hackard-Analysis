# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Background
I was challenged to create the new list of potential mentors. I had to create a query that returns a list of current employees eligible for retirement, as well as their most recent titles. I was also challenged to perform a query that shows a count of how many current employees of each title are presently eligible for retirement. The end result will be the potential mentorâ€™s employee number, first and last name, their title, birth date and employment dates.

### Materials
pgAdmin 4 <br /> 
Visual Studio Code 1.41.1 <br /> 
departments.csv  <br /> 
dept_emp.csv  <br />

title.csv  <br /> 

### Summary
Through my qury, I found that there were 48,700 employees eligible to retire.
I also found that there are 1,549 employees avaible for the mentor role.
